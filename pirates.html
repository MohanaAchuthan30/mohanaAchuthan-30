	<p>     In 1720, while sailing to Port Royal, Jamaica, aboard the HMS Dauntless, Governor Weatherby Swann, his daughter Elizabeth and crew encounter a shipwreck and recover a boy, Will Turner.<br>
	 Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate medallion around his neck and takes it. Eight years later, Captain James Norrington is promoted to commodore and proposes to Elizabeth. <br>
	 Her corset makes her faint and fall into the sea, causing the medallion to emit a pulse. Captain Jack Sparrow, having just arrived in Port Royal to commandeer a ship, rescues Elizabeth. Norrington identifies Jack as a pirate, and a chase ensues.<br>
	  Jack encounters Will, now a blacksmith. They duel, and Jack is imprisoned. That night, the Black Pearl attacks Port Royal, searching for the medallion. The crew of the Pearl captures Elizabeth, taking her to meet Captain Barbossa. Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner to conceal her identity as the governor's daughter. <br>
	  Barbossa explains that the medallion is one of 882 gold pieces that his crew took from a treasure of Hernán Cortés on Isla de Muerta as a payment to stop the massacre against the Aztecs but Cortes, being too greedy, rejected it, and the Aztec gods put a curse on the treasure. This cursed Barbossa and his crew, turning them into immortals who appear skeletal in moonlight. <br>
	  Barbossa and his crew have returned all but one of the pieces, with Elizabeth's medallion being the final piece. Barbossa takes her prisoner, believing she is the daughter of William "Bootstrap Bill" Turner, Will's father and a previous crewmate of the Pearl, whose blood is needed to lift the curse, and who Barbossa killed after he sent the medallion to Will as revenge for the mutiny against Jack..</p>

	<p> That night, the Dauntless arrives at Isla de Muerta. Jack tells Norrington he will lure the pirates out to be ambushed by the crew of the Dauntless, but instead persuades Barbossa's crew to attack the Dauntless before they lift the curse and lose their immortality. 
	 Elizabeth escapes the Dauntless and frees Jack's crew from the brig of the Pearl. They refuse to rescue Jack and Will, so Elizabeth sets out on her own while Jack's crew depart aboard the Pearl. Jack again switches sides, freeing Will and dueling Barbossa, while Elizabeth and Will fight off Barbossa's crewmen. <br>
	 When Barbossa stabs Jack, it is revealed that Jack took a piece of gold from the chest and is likewise cursed and unable to die. Jack shoots Barbossa, and Will returns both coins to the chest with his and Jack's blood on them. The curse is lifted; Barbossa dies from Jack's gunshot, and the rest of Barbossa's crew, no longer immortal, are arrested.<br>
	
	At Port Royal, Jack is to be hanged for piracy. Elizabeth diverts Norrington's attention while Will attempts a rescue, but Jack and Will are surrounded. Elizabeth intercedes and declares her love for Will. <br>
	Governor Swann pardons Will and gives his blessing for Elizabeth to marry him. Jack dives into the sea and escapes aboard the nearby Pearl, reclaiming the ship and his new crew. Norrington permits Jack and the Pearl "one day's head start" before initiating pursuit..</p>
